But it allows more - we know the data, we know when beer will end in the tank, and we know which types of beers are sold most often. Together with Cesarska we created and successfuly applied working cloud solution to few pubs in Poland. Currently 3 pubs open - Katowice, Sosnowiec, and Wroc\u0142aw (Poland). Cybertap \u00b6 Client side \u00b6 No more queues, history access, possibility to top up card over internet. Recommendations, notifications and news.
